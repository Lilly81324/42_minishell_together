X = done
? = halfway done

Your shell should:
X • Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
X • Have a working history.
X • Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).
• Use at most one global variable to indicate a received signal. Consider the
implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will not access your
main data structures.
Be careful. This global variable must only store the signal number
and must not provide any additional information or access to data.
Therefore, using "norm" type structures in the global scope is
forbidden.

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
? • Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence.
? • Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
• Implement the following redirections:
X ◦ < should redirect input.
X ◦ > should redirect output.
◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
X >> should redirect output in append mode.
X Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.
• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline.
• Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
• Your shell must implement the following built-in commands:
X echo with option -n
X ◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
X ◦ pwd with no options
X ◦ export with no options
X ◦ unset with no options
X ◦ env with no options or arguments
X ◦ exit with no options

Bonus part
Your program must implement:
• && and || with parenthesis for priorities.
• Wildcards * should work for the current working directory.
The bonus part will only be evaluated if the mandatory part is
completed perfectly. Perfect means the mandatory part is fully
implemented and functions without any issues. If you have not passed
ALL the mandatory requirements your bonus part will not be evaluated
at all.

Submission and peer-evaluation
Submit your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your
repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don’t hesitate to double-check the names
of your files to ensure they are correct.
